        <p class="paragraph">I'd like to thank first my teache, The Great and Glorious My. Peixoto, 
            for teaching me basically everything I know about computers and programming. My parents,
            for being my parents. My uncle, who gave me the laptop I'm writing this on. And my good
            friend <a href="https://github.com/Amitav-Krishna" class="hyperlink">Amitav Krishna</a>, who is frustratingly really good at programming and an absolute
            genius. His website is <a href="https://amitavkrishna.com" class="hyperlink">amitavkrishna.com</a>.
