        <p class="paragraph">Currently in my second year of high school. Taking a lot of computer classes and on my way to speaking 
            French fluently. I'm working through the Odin Project right now, though I've barely started. I'm already pretty good with
            html and css, and some knowledge of python. I also know a fair amount about the physical side of computing.</p>
